## 代码实现
 - 游戏使用**C++语言**以及**EasyX**库进行编写
 - 若要下载代码进行运行，请先配置好EasyX库
 - 因为此游戏为本人第一次做上千行的游戏编写，所以在代码实现，接口配置，以及内部函数分布等相关内容上不太熟练，会有诸如一大堆东西塞在main函数里的情况，敬请谅解

## Gameplay
<img width="960" alt="联想截图_20241226162323" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edcc9b6b-a35c-4589-93d4-dd3f27a4f8d4" />

- At the top of the game is the title, and there are eight boxes below with options in them. **You need to select the options whose text display colors correspond to that of the title**. For specific rules, please refer to the introduction on the "Game Rules" interface within the game.
- The game is divided into four modes, namely **"Speed Racing Mode", "Survival Mode", "Single Limit Mode" and "Hell Mode"**. For specific rules, please refer to the introduction on the "Game Rules" interface within the game. 

## Code Implementation
- The game is programmed using the **C++ language** and the **EasyX** library.
- If you want to download the code and run it, please configure the EasyX library first.
- Since this is the first time that I have written a game with thousands of lines of code, I'm not quite proficient in aspects related to code implementation, interface configuration, and the distribution of internal functions. There may be situations like a large number of things stuffed into the main function. Your understanding is highly appreciated. 

## Acknowledgments
- I'm extremely grateful to *my roommate who is a big fan of "The Binding of Isaac Rebirth"*, as well as the group friends in the "*Discussion on Kiting Ghosts in Identity V*" group and those in the "*Minecraft*" group for their support in the aspect of art.
- Meanwhile, I'd like to thank all the friends who devoted their precious time and offered valuable suggestions during the trial play stage of "Color Trap".
- I couldn't have completed such a wonderful game without you.
- I also appreciate that all of you in front of the screen are willing to visit this interface to learn about my game and are willing to play this game. **Your support is the driving force for me to move forward!**
